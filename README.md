# 2019 Open Data Report

The repository is the digital version of the NYC Open Data Team's ten year strategy. The complete 2019 open data report and strategy can be found [here](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019_OpenDataForAllReport.pdf).

## Structure

This site is built around the simple structure of an `index.html` page. Styles are handled in the `main.scss` file, and compiled with Gulp. Scroll events use the [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) library.

### Installation

After cloning the repository, run `npm install` to install dependencies. If you've previously installed gulp globally run `gulp` to compile assets, and launch a virtual server on your local machine. If gulp isn't installed globally you can run `npm install --global gulp-cli` to do so. More info on gulp can be found in [its documentation](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start).
