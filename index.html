        <h2>New York City isn’t the same as it was ten years ago, and neither is the data that drives us. </h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>Since the publication of NYC&rsquo;s first online public dataset in 2009, open data has always thrived because of the people behind it: the data scientists who discover insights from the millions of rows of information; the organizations who take the time to ask us about the data; the agency open data coordinators who work to ensure that data is accurate and identify new datasets for publication; and the many partners who organize open data panels, curricula, workshops, and demos.</p>
        <p>Our team has consistently worked to scale the collaborative spirit that has helped shape this program, and this year, we&rsquo;re building a new strategic plan from the ground-up&mdash;working alongside this diverse open data community.</p>
        <p>Below, you will find an in-depth look at the new Open Data Strategic Plan that will guide our work for the next 10 years. This plan draws from our City&rsquo;s open data journey to date, and pushes us to collectively invest in and strengthen our publishing platform and policies, as well as build more connections between City data and New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>By developing this plan through a robust co-design process, and by sharing it with you, our hope is that the next decade of open data will continue to be defined by the same commitment to collaboration that brought us to today.</p>
